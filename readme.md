# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Frederick Cantarine

I am taking this class because it is required for my major, that being Media Arts. I am hoping to learn
how to create my own work on the web through code and that in doing this, I can get a better understanding
if this is something I want to incorperate in my career. In taking this class, I hope to learn how to make
my own webste without relying on someone else's framework. This calss will also help me stay somewhat
active in coding which I might need for eiter future classes or perhpas in my career.

The Internet is made up of a large number of independly operated networks. It provides information and communication options to allow people to further connect with eachother.
- I didn't know that the Internet was not the same as the Web.
- I didn't know that the Internet connects participants but the Web connects information.
- I didn't know there's website that tells you how many facebook likes, tweets and emails..etc. that are send every second.
- 80% of the web is not indexed.
- Computers we use everyday are called clients and are not servers.
