Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.
1. Information on the internet goes from one computer to another in a packet of
information. A packet does not necessarily take the shortest route but instead
has to consider what route will take it the least amount of time. If a package
of information is too big, then breaking it up into different packets is one way
in which it can insure all it's parts will end up where they need to go. These
different packets may not all take the same route but all go towards the same
destination. Each packet has the internet address of where it came from and
where it is going.

when trying to go to a specific location.
